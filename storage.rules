/**
 * @fileoverview
 * This ruleset secures the Firebase Storage bucket.
 *
 * Security Strategy:
 * - Read Access: Granted to any authenticated user. Since the application uses
 *   anonymous authentication, any user actively using the app will be authenticated
 *   and can therefore generate download URLs needed for the import process.
 * - Write Access: Denied for all client-side operations. This is a critical
 *   security measure to prevent unauthorized uploads or modifications directly
 *   from the browser. All data should be added to storage via trusted server
 *   processes if needed in the future.
